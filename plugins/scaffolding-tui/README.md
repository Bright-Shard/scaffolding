# scaffolding-tui
A terminal UI library for Scaffolding.

The main example of this is in [examples/todo](../../examples/todo).

This library supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. Other UNIX-family OSes will *probably* also work but haven't been tested.

Colours may not render correctly on terminals that don't support RGB colour formatting.

Huge thanks to:

- https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html, a great guide on working with low-level terminal nonsense
- https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797, a brilliant list of ANSI sequences for controlling the terminal
